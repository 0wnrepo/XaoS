 o	Image library now backstores just windows, where it is necesary
 	(the detection is quite silly, but IMO works in most cases)
 o	New help system :))
 o	Added command line options for selecting window id and printing menu
        specification (should be possibly usefull for tcl/tk or possibly other
        separate GUIs)
 o	First version of Tcl/Tk interface by Charles Vidal
 o	Some additions into help file and fixes in xshl library
