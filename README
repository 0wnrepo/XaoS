XaoS - a real time fractal zoomer and morpher
=============================================

Original authors of XaoS are Jan Hubicka (jh@ucw.cz) and Thomas  Marsh
(tmarsh@tivoli.com). Many other people contributed to the project as
well. Their list is too long to be included here. See AUTHORS file in
the XaoS distribution.


INTRODUCTION
------------

XaoS is a fast portable real-time interactive fractal zoomer. It
displays the Mandelbrot set (among other escape time fractals) and
allows you to zoom smoothly into the fractal. Various coloring modes are
provided for both the points inside and outside the selected set. In
addition, switching between Julia and Mandelbrot fractal types and
displaying planes is provided. The first version was a poorly written
Mandelbrot viewer by Thomas later modified by Jan to support high
frame-rate zooming. Other additions were later made including autopilot 
(for those of you without driver licenses), palette changing, PNG
saving, and fractal inversion.


SUPPORTED PLATFORMS
-------------------

Starting from version 3.5, the supported platforms are:

  * Posix (Linux, Unix, FreeBSD, ...)
  * Microsoft Windows (95, 98, XP)
  * Mac OS X
  
The following platforms were also supported in earlier 3.x versions:

  * BeOS
  * Old Macintosh versions
  * Microsoft DOS
  * OS/2
  * Plan 9

Due to the lack of volunteers interested in maintaing older platforms, we are
discontinuing support for them.


To compile XaoS you need ANSI compliant compiler with GOOD
optimizations. All supported platforms use a common configure script for
setting up the needed Makefiles. Please read the INSTALL file for
details.
