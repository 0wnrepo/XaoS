We would like to release a quality product in all manner. Unfortunately,
such a complex software like XaoS requires many details and it does not
seem to be so easy to put a quality software together.

Well, we did all our best... Here come the latest prerelease binaries
for Linux, Windows and DOS. They should work with the following
restrictions:

1. The Linux version seems to be the most stable one. Almost
   no bugs were encountered testing it the last few weeks.
   SuSE 7.3 and SuSE 8.0 should be good enough to compile
   it. The latest source has been also tested on the Compile
   Farm of SourceForge.net with the next results:
   
   * [x86] Linux 2.4 (Debian 2.2)
     Compiles OK. Seems to be build properly.
     
   * [x86] Linux 2.4 (Red Hat 7.3)
     Compiles OK, runs properly. It is suggested to
     configure it with --with-mitshm=no to avoid immediate
     exit after startup. Runs correctly in an X11 window
     on cf.sf.net.
     
   * [x86] FreeBSD (4.7-STABLE)
     ./configure exits properly, make stops with an error.
     
   * [Alpha] Linux 2.2 (Debian 3.0)
     ./configure exits properly, make stops with an error
     during compiling ui.c.
     
   * [PPC - G4] MacOS X 10.1 SERVER Edition
     Compiles OK, the executable gave MIT/SHM problem
     with "./configure". It should work with --with-mithsm=no,
     but currently I have no access to any Mac OS X
     systems to test this.
     
   * [Sparc - Ultra60] Linux 2.4 (Debian 3.0)
     Compiles OK, seems to be build properly.
     
   * [Sparc - R220] Sun Solaris (8)
     ./configure stops with an error.
     
   * [CerfCube SA 1110] Linux 2.4 (Debian 3.0)
     Compiles OK, seems to be build properly.
     
   * [J2EE] IBM WebSphere
     Compiles OK, runs properly.
     
   I tried to run the executables, mostly I got "Cannot initialize
   driver", except where I wrote "runs propery" above. I'm almost sure
   that those platforms I wrote "seems to be build properly" for, XaoS
   will work without any problems, because there should be only "Can't
   open display"-related configuration errors on cf.sf.net and/or at my
   place.
   
   You can also realize that internationalization (i18n) will only work
   if you install XaoS as the system administrator with "make install".
   Future releases may solve this problem.
   
   Tcl/Tk interface now works, but it is not updated since a rather long
   time. You can run it entering "wish ./xaosmenu.tcl &" in a Unix shell
   in the bin/ directory. This interface is experimental.
   
   Under SVGAlib latin2 fonts will not work for some internationalized
   messages.
   
   For compilation with Aalib, you need version 1.4 which can be
   downloaded from http://aa-project.sf.net.
   
2. Microsoft DOS users will enjoy i18n if their system supports it.
   Unfortunately some systems have to have plain DOS to make i18n
   available. Many Windows systems also support running batch
   files from native Windows, however not all (my Windows NT 4
   does not). DOS users should run xaos-??.bat in the bin\
   directory.
   
   Note that some messages in latin2 fonts will not be displayed
   correctly.
   
   Aalib may not work 100% correctly. It may depend on your DPMI
   settings. You should download the latest csdpmi*.zip package.   
   
   If you want to compile XaoS from scratch, you should download
   the following software:
   
   aalib-1.4rc5.tar.gz, all402.zip, bnu213b.zip, djdev203.zip,
   fil41b.zip, gcc2952b.zip, gtxt040b.zip, licv17b.zip, mak3791.zip,
   png1012b.zip, txi42b.zip, zlib114b.zip.
   
   Aalib must be patched to compile it (I sent a patch to the
   SourceForge Tracker) and libvga and libtext (needed for Aalib) must
   be also installed. Note that libtext will not compile under the
   newest DJGPP, if someone know why DJGPP fails to compile the
   appropriate assembly code, please write to us.
   
3. Microsoft Windows users should try xaos.exe, xaosnlsmp.exe
   or xaosmp.exe. The first one contains no i18n, the other one is
   compiled with supporting i18n and multiprocessors. The
   third one is build with support for multiprocessors,
   but no i18n. For details on get XaoS work with i18n support
   please read README.WIN.
   
   xaos.exe and xaosmp.exe will give you the option to change the
   language. In opposite, xaosnlsm.exe will not give you any chance to
   make language changing possible because it will autodetect your
   national environment (if any).
   
4. Here is a list about recent bugs and problems:
     
   * Fixing Macintosh version (load/save works incorrectly).
   * Checking why Bailout item is duplicated in Windows help.
   * Displaying latin2 fonts correctly.
   * Fixing catalog files (mainly French and Spanish).
   * Filling up i18n for menu files for some languages.
   * Fixing Macintosh version (crash when loading random examples).
   * Fixing Windows version (crash when several times saving files
     and configurations).
   * Fixing generated xaos.dlg for certain languages (e.g. Hungarian).
   * Fixing crashing configure/make for all problematic platforms.
   * Rewriting i18n to be easier to add new menus and others.
   * All other todos announced in TODO file.

That's all. However the problem list is quite long, we hope
you will enjoy XaoS 3.1.

Credits:

Jan Hubicka is the main author of XaoS. He wrote the biggest parts of
this program. In fact, all important thing was done by him.

Andreas Madritsch helped a lot putting together version 3.1. He also
compiled the DOS and Windows executable and made German translations of
menu items available. He added bailout and 3 fractal types into version
3.1. He also fixed i18n to work under Windows correctly.

Zoltan Kovacs wrote this documentation about the recent installation
problems and he was finalizing release 3.1. He added i18n support into
XaoS and cleaned up the code as it was possible.

Many others helped as well. The full list of them can be seen in file
AUTHORS.
