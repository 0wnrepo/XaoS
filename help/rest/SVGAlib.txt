SVGAlib driver
==============

This is a driver for Linux SVGAlib. I really like this driver, because I much
prefer full screen zooming instead of a small 320x320 window in X11. It was one
of the first drivers for XaoS and is fully featured. The following problems can
occur:

XaoS doesn't initialize graphics mode

    when started under users other than root SVGAlib requires root privileges
    to directly access the hardware. When you really want to start XaoS as a
    normal user, enable the suid bit (chmod +s) at XaoS executable. note that I
    take care to disable all security holes caused by this bit so I believe it
    is safe.

Mouse doesn't work

Screen is blank at higher resolutions

    Both this problems are probably caused by misconfiguration of SVGAlib.
    Please configure it in etc/vga/libvga.cong or /usr/local/lib/libvga.conf
    GPM can also cause problems. Try to kill it before starting XaoS.

When I switch console I can't switch back

    This is another typical SVGAlib bug. Try to hold F key longer than alt. It
    helps on my computer. On older SVGAlib there was a famous "enter bug" that
    caused a crash after pressing enter. Try to update to a newer release.

SVGAlib driver was written by Jan Hubicka, 1997.
