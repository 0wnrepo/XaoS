Filters
=======

Filters are a post-calculation effect applied to the resulting image. They can
do things like motion blurring, edge detection, emulation of palettes or
truecolor on displays that can't handle them, and such things. There is a
:ref:`tutorial chapter <[tutor:filter.xaf]>` about them.
