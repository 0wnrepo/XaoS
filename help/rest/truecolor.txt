Truecolor emulator
==================

XaoS can work in either `palette`_ or truecolor mode. Both modes have
advantages and disadvantages. Palette mode allows effects such as palette
rotation, while truecolor mode allows smoother `incoloring`_ and `outcoloring`_
modes and the `truecolor coloring`_ modes. If your display is 8bpp, you can
enable this filter to get truecolor emulation (but, obviously, not with as many
colors as a real truecolor display).
