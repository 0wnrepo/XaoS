.. _textsleep:

Wait for text
=============

**Syntax**:(textsleep)

This function's behavior is very similar to `usleep`_, but the time is
calculated from the number of letters currently displayed onscreen. If you want
to wait just long enough for the user to read the subtitle, use this function.
The user can alter the replay speed as desired using `letterspersec`_. This
value can be changed during replay with the arrow keys.

**Available as**: command

.. _`usleep`:
    [help:usleep]

.. _`letterspersec`:
    [help:letterspersec]
