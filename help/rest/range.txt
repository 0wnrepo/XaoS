Solid guessing range
====================

**Syntax**:(range integer)

XaoS has a solid guessing optimization: if all corners of a rectangle have the
same color, it assumes that the whole rectangle is a solid colored block, and
doesn't calculate points inside the rectangle. This optimization saves lots of
calculation, but sometimes introduces errors. This value alters the maximum
size of the rectangle that can be guessed at one time. The default value is 3;
use 0 to disable the optimization.
