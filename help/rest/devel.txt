Development
===========

XaoS is free software. One of the most significant rights its :ref:`license
<gpl>` grants to you is the right to **freely get, study and improve** its
source code, which is available from the XaoS homepage.

If you want to do some development, you are encouraged to send your work back
to the :ref:`authors <about>`; if it is well done, it will be added to the next
release. All changes should be submitted to the SourceForge patch tracker:
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=5771&atid=305771

XaoS has an open development model. All development is coordinated via the
SourceForge website (http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/xaos). Development
versions are available via CVS (see http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=5771
for instructions), so if you are interested in the future of XaoS, give the
latest source a try! We also have a several :ref:`mailing lists <support>`,
where you can subscribe if you want to be informed about latest releases,
discuss XaoS with others, or participate in the development process.

XaoS is quite easily extensible. You might want to read a bit about its
internals in the file **doc/xaosdev.info**. XaoS is also portable, so if it
doesn't work on your favorite platform (or there is just an old version
available), you could quite easily port it.

Volunteer Opportunities
-----------------------

XaoS needs volunteers to make it the best fractal program it can be! You don't
have to be a programmer to help. The following tasks open to volunteers:

Improving the documentation via the Wiki (and improving the DokuWiki
converter).

Compiling binaries for your favorite operating system.

Reviewing the source code, adding comments, and checking lines which generate
warnings during compilation.

Creating additional tutorials and examples.

Translating XaoS into your language.

Implementing feature requests.

Fixing outstanding bugs.

If you would like to volunteer, join the mailing lists and let us know. We
would be happy to help you get started!
