How to write XaoS help files
============================

XaoS help is stored in the file help/xaos.hlp. It is divided into parts, each
part being started by a **keyword**. In the help file keywords are written as
%keyword

If you are writing documentation about some command in the XaoS function
registry, use the same keyword as the name of the command in order to make
context sensitive help work.

The help file is written in a special format called `xshl`_.

.. _`xshl`:
    xaoshelp://xshl
