.. _morphlastline:

Morph last line
---------------

**Syntax**:(morphlastline keyword complex complex)

This function has the same functionality as `morphline`_, but it doesn't
increase the line key, and touches the line with the previous key. This is
useful when you want to move a just-drawn line--you don't need to set
`linekey`_ back.

**Available as**: command

.. _`linekey`:
    [help:linekey]

.. _`morphline`:
    [help:morphline]
