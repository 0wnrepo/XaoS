Animate view
============

**Syntax**:(animateview float float float float)

This function is almost identical to function `view`_. It expects that the view
will be changed only slightly, so recalculation is done with ANIMATE priority.
This means that dynamic resolution is used by default.

Viewport is selected by the center and two radiuses (real and imaginary). See
`view`_ for more information.

**Available as**: command

.. _`view`:
    [help:uiview]
