:ref:`An introduction to fractals <[tutor:fractal.xaf]>` 

	Try this animated
	tutorial if you don't know what a fractal is. If you are new to XaoS you should
	try it too, since it is quite a good example of XaoS's features.

:ref:`XaoS features overview <[tutor:features.xaf]>` 

	Watch this tutorial to
	discover more of XaoS's features.

Both the tutorials are divided into chapters and available from help menu, so
you don't need to watch them all at once (they are about half an hour long).
