DOS driver
==========

This is a fully featured driver for DJGPP and allegro. It supports many VGA
modes, VESA 1.0--3.0, VBE/AF, S3 and some other cards.

The following problems may occur:

Some DPMI servers may cause problems

    Some DPMI servers like the one from Novell/Dr/Open DOS are buggy. Use clean
    DOS instead and XaoS will automatically start cwsdpmi. Under Open Dr DOS
    use dpmi off at command line to disable it.

Higher resolutions don't work

    If your videocard has enough memory for the selected resolution, you most
    probably have an unsupported videocard. Please use a VESA BIOS extension on
    this videocard. (See the note about VESA at the end of this section.)

XaoS needs a coprocessor

    I don't distribute a coprocessor library linked into XaoS because it is too
    slow for a real-time zoomer. Coprocessor emulation will not help, because
    xaos works in protected mode.

XaoS needs mouse driver to be usable

XaoS works slowly in higher resolution

    This could also be caused by Allegro's slow driver or your videocard's VESA
    BIOS. You could try some other VESA BIOS extension instead. Look at the
    `FreeBE project`_ or Scitech Display
    Doctor package. (See the note about VESA at the end of this section.)

VESA
----

VESA is a standard for using higher resolutions in DOS. Many videocards have
VESA support in the BIOS so you don't need any additional software, while
others need support from a special program. Also some VESA BIOS implementations
are buggy or suboptimal; there are 3 different versions, version 1.0 is many
times slower than 2.0, which has support for protected mode and linear
framebuffers. So if you have problems with higher resolutions, or some graphics
modes are not available (like 320x200 truecolor), you might try some software
package which emulates VESA.

The most famous VESA emulating program is Scitech Display Doctor. It has
support for many videocards and is quite reliable. It's disadvantage is that it
is shareware and works for only 30 days. You might also look on ftp.simtel.net,
where there are many VESA emulation packages such as s3vbe or the new 
`FreeBe project`_.

DOS driver was written by Jan Hubicka, 1997.
