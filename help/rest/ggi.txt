GGI driver
==========

GGI stands for General Graphics Interface. Part of this project is to develop
libggi, a portable graphics library, and XaoS's GGI driver uses that. It is
experimental, since the API of libggi is not stabilized yet. There are some
problems with keyboard handling--the shift key doesn't work yet.

Everything else might work well, but there are no guarantees. It is alpha
quality software.

GGI driver was written by Jan Hubicka, 1998.
