Plan9 driver
============

Plan9 is a very nice small operating system by the authors of Unix at Bell
Labs. It is very incompatible with other operating systems; even the C compiler
and header files are different, but XaoS should work well there (even on the
limited free demo installation without any POSIX compatibility stuff)

There are a few limitations: the file selector and image saving don't work. You
can save position files and then later render them on the other OS, or save
screenshots.

Plan9 terminals also don't provide any way to catch the arrow keys, so you
can't use them. Use the mouse to navigate in the menus. Also, getting the
screen resolution is impossible, so use -pixelwidth and -pixelheight instead of
-screenwidth and -screenheight.

By default XaoS changes the colormap. This will collide with other colorful
programs like Mortha. You can disable this behavior using -nopalette switch,
but this will slow down XaoS.

Plan9 driver was written by Jan Hubicka, 1997.
