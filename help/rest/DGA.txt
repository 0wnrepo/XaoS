DGA driver
==========

This is the driver for DGA (Direct Graphics Architecture) extension used by
XFree86 X servers. It is pretty new so it could be buggy.

Bugs/limitations:

In 8bpp mode, XaoS has problems with the palette with certain window managers

    I don't know why this happens. Just let me know what's wrong, or use
    another window manager.

Banked modes are not supported.

    I don't have any card to test this with, so it doesn't work in the current
    version.

DGA driver was written by Jan Hubicka, 1999.
