TODO
::::::::::::::
	o	Ispell menus
	o	Disable assertions
	o	Update catalogs for tutorials
	o	Fix -threads 200 problem
	o	Fix multithreaded boundary trace algorithm
	o	Fix window handling in 24bpp mode.
	o	Remove playstring, because it is obsolette now
	o	Document smoothmorph
	o	Documentation/Windowed directX driver/win32 driver/back ->
	crash

	o	Make this list shorter :)
	o	Solve syncing in X driver...
	o	X windows screen saver version idea:
			calculate big mandelbrot.
			then using autopilot select good point
			display smaller rectangle(320x200) and make
			zoom to this point inside.
			Do this repeativly for more points.then you
			will get main mandelbrot with more zoom
			windows. Select most interesting one.
			Make it big again.
			and repeat :)
			Easy! isn't it?
	o	more ports of course..
	o	video seqencess saving. Make support for creating 
		movie file with saved movements and possibly calculated
		points. This should make very small movie files with
		aporox 1113 points for one frame. 500kb=500 frames=25
		seconds of animation with compression about 50%(runlength
		or lzo library) 
	o	automatic recalculation of videos for other resolution 
		or configuration. Because movie filles will require 
		exactly same optimalisations and movements as they 
		were created. 
Please contact me if you want to do something from this long todo :)

TODO.Be
::::::::::::::
  *  Avoid mouse pooling in DirectScreen driver
  *  Figure out how to get image directory in translator
  *  Fix configure dialog in XaoS translator
  *  Does translator need to support all bitmap types?
  *  figure out how to get the red, green and blue masks in DirectScreen
  *  Support for scripting - XaoS's internal scripting langugage should be
     probably well mapped to Be's scripting system. But I am not sure how much is
     usefull and I would like to see any good examples for usage of scripting first.
  *  Change XaoS to the Media Node producing video stream from XaoS save
     files.... How much this can be usefull? For recording XaoS's videos?
     filtering it using Be's Nodes?
     Can we use it for interactive mode too? Can be this usefull for
     something? Anyway I seems to like Be's node system (very similar to
     filter system internaly used by XaoS) and I would like to try it's
     programming.
     Maybe the GUI should be external program starting XaoS Node use the
     scripting (or send the XaoS's commands) to control XaoS. Then we should
     probably add any Be's filtering node to XaoS's filtering system...
