CREDITS:
        Original authors of XaoS are Jan Hubicka (jh@ucw.cz)
	and Thomas Marsh (tmarsh@tivoli.com)

	Many other people contributed to the project as well.
	Their list is too long to be included here. See doc/AUTHORS
	in the XaoS distribution.

INTRODUCTION:
	XaoS is a fast portable real-time interactive fractal zoomer.
	It displays the Mandelbrot set (among other escape time 
	fractals) and allows you to zoom smoothly into the fractal.  
	Various coloring modes are provided for both the points inside 
	and outside the selected set. In addition, switching between 
	Julia and Mandelbrot fractal types and displaying planes is 
	provided. The first version was a poorly written Mandelbrot 
	viewer by Thomas later modified by Jan to support high frame-rate 
	zooming. Other additions were later made including autopilot 
	(for those of you without drivers licenses), palette changing, 
	PNG saving, and fractal inversion.

SUPPORTED PLATFORMS(for now)

        UNIX LIKE:
	  X11 (8bpp pseudocolor 8,15,16,24,32 truecolor, StaticGray and 
	       StaticColor only, supports MItshm and DGA extension of xfree86 servers)
          SVGAlib       (svgalib 1.2.10 or newer recomended)
	  AA-lib        (high quality ascii art)
	  GGI		(General graphics interface)

	OTHER OS:   (with native support):

	  BeOS (R4, both Intel and PowerPC, supports windowed and fullscreen
	        mode, native user interface, drag&drop, works as translator)
	  Macintosh (only version 2.1, displays with 8bit support only)
	  MS-DOS (djgpp/allegro - VESA 3.0/2.0/1.0, VBE/AF
				8,15,16 and 32 bit depths,
	                        VGA - 320x200 and X modes, 
				resolutions 256x256-1200x1600)
		  AAlib - approx. 50 different text modes for VGA/MDA
		     including dual monitor support)
	  OS/2      (320x200, VESA, XFree86 and many text modes)
	  plan9     (8 1/2 terminals)
	  Windows   Win32 and directX support, 8, 16, 24 and 32 bpp
	  	    displays, native user interface

	KNOWN TO WORK ALSO AT:

	  Hurd
	  Amiga    (256 workbench displays only, using Xlib emulation)

	All platforms with at least ansi-c compatible compiler and text output

REQUIREMENTS:
	XaoS uses floating point math for its calculations. This may 
	be slow on some computers. The program was developed on 
	a Pentium running at 120 MHz, but it can work quite well (20fps)
	on 486Dx/2. I also received nice letters from users using 
	XaoS at 386/40 or so. Coprocessor is _REALLY_ required.
	Faster computer is better so alpha/600MHZ recomended.  

	To compile XaoS you need ANSI compliant compiler with _GOOD_ 
	optimizations.  Unix version uses configure script. Other 
	platforms uses different ways.  GNU CC is highly recommended. 
	Graphics drivers usually have some additional requirements. 
	(for example xlib for X11, djgpp and allegro for dos port)
	Also fast malloc/free routines are recomended because they
	are called quite often (10 times per frame). For full
	featured XaoS (with image saving code) you also need zlib
	and libpng.

	All can be found at the SourceForge site:
        http://xaos.sf.net

HOME-PAGE:
        Current homepage is http://xaos.sf.net

INSTALL:
	Installation methods are described in the file "INSTALL".

USAGE:
	Since version 2.0 XaoS have lots of command line options. 
	They depend on its configuration, available drivers etc.
	See xaos -h for full help. Usually more than one driver is
	available. XaoS after startup tries to auto-detect best one.
	For example in GNU/Linux case tests driver in following order:
	  SVGAlib
	  X11
	  AA
	  GGI
	  curses
	If you want to force text display instead of graphics you may
	use -driver curses. Use xaos -list for list of all available
	drivers.

	Once XaoS started, you may see animated tutorial by pressing 'H'
	twice or read help (by pressing 'H' once).
