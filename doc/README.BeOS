This driver version will work with BeOS R4 (and later, hopefully).
Some features which are still missing:

- All missing features are implemented now :)

XaoS 3.1 is multithreaded.  By default, the BeOS version uses this feature.
To run single-threaded, use "xaos -threads 1 ...".

HOW TO COMPILE:

Follow UNIX compiling instruction. In short run:
sh configure
make

HOW TO INSTALL:
Binary XaoS distributions will come with installation script. If you want
to do installation manually do following steps:
1) Always keep XaoS executable together with catalogs, tutorials, help and
   examples directory
2) enter examples directory and run sh buildhtml on the command line
   to build HTML version of help
3) do link of XaoS executable to /system/add-ons/Translators/XaoSTranslator and
   /system/add-ons/Media/XaoS.media_addon
