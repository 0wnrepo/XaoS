COMPILERS
=========

This document tries to describe common problems with various compilers.

It is currently ($Date: 2003-01-17 09:42:33 $) *out of date*.

XaoS is coded to be good target for optimizers and to make compiler bussy.
Problem is that it often forces compiler to crash or generate wrong code. This
is purpose why I am writting this document. Please try to find your compiler
to avoid some problems.

I highly recommend to use the gnu C compiler. I expect it will produce best
results at many platforms. I recommend an egcs project (http://www.cygnus.com/egcs)-a
development version of gcc. It produces much better results than gcc2.7.2.x
and 2.8.1. Older version of GCC may have serious problems when compiling XaoS.
Please let me know how they works. Also Slackware distributes gcc compiled
from the source tree patched for fortran frontend. This version seems to
generate incorrect results. This bug seems to be fixed in the latest
slackware.

In case some updates to this document will be required latest version will be placed
to XaoS homepage.

GNU C COMPILERS
===============

This code seems to be real gcc killer. Almost every gcc version does have troubles
with compiling XaoS. So this small document explains some tricks how to avoid problems.
It also contains optimal switches.

BTW:other optimizing compilers and borland usually crash immediately..so XaoS seems
    to be nice test for compilers

2.95.0
	this version is currently the latest gcc version and one that is XaoS
	developed on. It produces very good results (best from available
	compilers). Some simple patches to gcc makes output even better. I
	will try to push them into development version of gcc for next version
	and to pgcc based on this gcc.
2.7.2.[123](386-linux)
	this gcc compiles w/o problems with default switches
	(-m486 -O6 -ffast-math -fomit-frame-pointer -funroll-loops -fforce-mem -fforce-addr)
        If you are the Slackware user, see following paragraph:

2.7.2.[123](386-linux) patched for f77 frontend
        this gcc usually generates wrong code. It is one distributed by
	slakware. Later versions seems to work, so it is most likely bug
	caused by f77 frontend. You might update your gcc in case you have
	problems with this. In slakware you might update to compiler from
	the latest version, wich works

2.7.2p/pgcc(386-linux)
	Note that this patches does not helps a much acording to my tests
	and various versions of snapshots has various prolems. Use egcs(see
	bellow) instad. This compiler mostly slowdown even in comparation with
	pure 2.7.2.1
	-mpentium -O6 -ffast-math -fomit-frame-pointer -funroll-loops -fforce-mem -fforce-addr)

2.7.2.1	(djgpp)
	(-m486 -O6 -ffast-math -fomit-frame-pointer -funroll-loops -fforce-mem -fforce-addr)
egcs 
	Egcs is an development version of GCC based on pre2.8.1 source tree.
	It produces excelent results at XaoS code(30% speedup on pentium in
	new image recalculation over 2.7.2)
	So I highly recommend to use it. It is much better (at least in
	XaoS case) than "concurent" PGCC project witch currently brings
	slowdowns

	Configure script should automatically detect your procesor
	and choose optimal switches at intel platforms like this:

	-O2 -Wall -mpentim -fstrength-reduce -ffast-math -fomit-frame-pointer
	-fforce-mem -fforce-addr -funroll-loops -fmove-all-movables

	Of course change -mpentium to -m486 -m386 -mpentiumpro or some other
	procesor you have :)

	I highly recommend to enable -m68040 at mc68040 processors since
	software emulation of mc68881 is incredibly slow (at least at my
	HP-UX). This introduces about five times speedup. Approx same speed
	can be reached using -m68020-40. In fact some my tests had better
	results with this option (why?)

gcc2.8.0
gcc2.8.1
	XaoS compiled using gcc2.8.0/1 seems to work fine, but is slower than
	egcs. (in some cases even slover than 2.7.2)


Other versions
	I have no access to other gcc versions. So in case you have problems
	try following procedure:
	o disable optimizations at all. In case this does not help let me know
	o try normal optimizations but with -fno-strength-reduce and -fno-unroll-loops. 
	  In case this help try if just one of this switches should be disabled and let me 
	  know I will add this to document.
	o try -fno-inline -fno-strength-reduce and -fno-unrool-loops. In case this helps
	  please try to discover witch inline makes crash(you may use -Q option)
	  and let me know
	o try -Q to discover where compiler crashes and let me know.

HP-UX compilers
===============
version 7.5/8.0 at series 300 (motorola):
	Compiler seems to have serious problems with long double. When enabled
	it generates code with invalid opcodes. When you turn off
	optimization, resulting executable forces system panic in fp emulation
	code. Since long double is software emulated, I don't recomment to use
	it at all. 

	Options I use:-Aa -D_INCLUDE_POSIX_SOURCE -D_INCLUDE_HPUX_SOURCE
	-D_INCLUDE_XOPEN_SOURCE +O3  -v

	Please do not use +F since it seems to introduce kernel panic
	(at least for me).

	Also note that file save.c requires long time to compile when
	optimized (approx half an hour?) but then it works. Just be patient.

	XaoS is also very slow when compiled. This is most probably because CC
	don't support the MC68040 and generates FP instructions for
	coprocessor. GCC don't do that, so it's code is MUCH faster. At the
	other hand, in rare cases it seems to cause kernel panic (because I
	have very old kernel, wich probably don't have good emulation) so
	be curefull.
version 10.x at series 700 (PA-RISC)
	Jens Killian reported that XaoS compiles fine there with long double
	disabled. He uses following options:

        export CC=cc
        export CFLAGS="-Aa -D_HPUX_SOURCE +Oall -I/usr/include/X11R6"
        export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/lib/X11R6"
        ./configure
Retargetable C compiler (lcc)
	This compiler has troubles with compiling zoom.c. I am unable to make
	it working
SGI C compilers
	This compiler does (according my tests) slightly worse job that gcc(few %).
	For 32 bit architectures I use: -32 -O2 (since -O3 should require
	modifications to Makefiles)

	For 64 bit/32n use -64/-32 and: -O3 -GCM:aggressive_speculation=ON 
          -GCM:static_load_speculation=ON -OPT:alias=restric -OPT:roundoff=3 
          -OPT:IEEE_arithmetic=3
	This causes slight speedup...
        mips-sgi-irix6.2
Ultrasparc
	At this architecture sun CC just with -O seems to beat gcc, mainly
	because of ugly pipeline support for it.
