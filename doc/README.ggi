The GGI driver is now very experimental. There is not much
documentation about GGI api, so I am not sure, if it is correct.
There is few known problems with keyboard handling - I don't know
constants for keys like escape or backspace. Also don't know
how to detect ascii value of key - so shift don't work.

Let me know about all problems
