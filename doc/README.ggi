The GGI driver is now very experimental. There is not much documentation
about GGI API, so I am not sure, if it is correct. There are a few known
problems with keyboard handling --- I don't know constants for keys like
escape or backspace. Also don't know how to detect ascii value of key -
so shift doesn't work.

Let me know about all problems.
