Hi,

I am Czech student, and as everyone I need some money for living,
to keep my computer hardware up to date, girls etc :).
Because I am spending lots of time by working on free software projects,
my situation isn't the best. If you use my programs, I would like
to ask you to send my some small amount of money.
This donations helps me to do more work on my projects and avoid 
some boring commercial jobs. 

I have already received some money, that helped me to buy computer
to Prague, upgarde my HDD, buy some books and hercules (and XaoS
now supports text mode :).  Thank you very much. 

I would also like to say "thank you" to someone from Brasil, whom send
me the money, but I was unable to contact him by email, since address
in letter didn't worked. So hope that he will read this file and see
my thanks here.

If you wish help me or to XaoS development, please send some money to

Jan Hubicka
Dukeskych bojovniku 1944
Tabor 390 03
Czech Republic

I must say, that I am not only author of whole XaoS, but I've done
most of main routines.  Author of other parts are listed at the AUTHORS
files. So if you wish, you may contact contact them too.

We also created an Czech Free Software Foundation targeting to support
development of free software in Czech Republic. Current projects are:

* Domain .gnu.cz (www server, ftp etc.)
* Linux for Czech Users
* Free Software for blind users
* DebianCZ (Czech support for Debian GNU/Linux distribution)
* Linux semminary

and others. If you wish to get more information about this organization,
browse its homepage at http://www.freesoft.cz. Information for
sponzors are at http://www.freesoft.cz/english/sponzor.txt

This program is part of GNU project. If you want to help GNU project, as
a whole, you might sponzor an FSF (Free Software Foundation). Please
see GNU homepage at http://www.gnu.org.
