.SH NAME
xaos - Fast interactive real-time fractal zoomer/morpher

.SH SYNOPSIS
xaos [options]

.SH DESCRIPTION

XaoS is a protable real-time interactive fractal zoomer/morpher.
The UNIX version works under X11, SVGA and text terminals.
If you don't know what fractal is or you want to know more about
XaoS features you should see the animated tutorial. 
.B \ Run XaoS and press 'H' twice.
It is much more fun than reading the boring manual page :) and it supports foreign
languages. You might also read the
.B \ xaos.info 
file for some advanced stuff
(like how to write animations and tutorials manually, port or extend XaoS,
algorithms used etc.)

.SH "OPTIONS"
XaoS' options should be divided into the following parts:
.TP
.B \ Ugly interface options
These options are common for all installations of XaoS because the only
interface available for now is the ugly interface.
.TP
.B \ Driver selection options
This options lets you choose the graphics driver.
.TP
.B \ Driver dependent options
These options depend on available drivers.
.SH "SCREEN SIZE OPTIONS"
XaoS needs exact knowledge of the screen size to make random dot stereograms
and for choosing good view areas for fractals. This should be done in two ways:
Choosing screen size or choosing pixel size. Screen size is best for fullscreen
drivers where resolution/pixel-size should be changed. On the other hand,
pixel size is best for windowed environments where some kind of virtual screen,
etc. should confuse calculation of pixel size from the screen size.
.TP
.B \-screenwidth
exact size of the screen in centimeters
.TP
.B \-screenheight
exact size of the screen in centimeters
.TP
.B \-pixelwidth
exact size of a pixel's width in centimeters
.TP
.B \-pixelheight
exact size of a pixel's height in centimeters
.SH "DRIVER SELECTION OPTIONS"
Every xaos installation has some graphics drivers. This depends on
which operating system you have, available libraries and configurations. XaoS
by default tries to enable the best available driver. So for example,
in the GNU/Linux case, it tests the drivers in the following order:
.br
SVGAlib
.br
X11
.br
curses
.br
The following options are used to control this operation:
.TP
.B \-driver    
This options lets you specify the driver to use and avoid autodetection.
.TP
.B \-list
List available drivers and then exit.

.SH "OTHER UI OPTIONS"
Other options are quite easy to understand and depends on XaoS configuration
and version, so I do not describe how to use them here.
.B \ xaos -help
for a complete list of options with descriptions.
.SH "BUGS"
There is no known bugs in this release. See the xaos home-page
