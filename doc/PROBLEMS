This file contains known XaoS problems

Warning:
This file should become out of date after the release of 3.1 version.
In this case an up to date version will be placed to XaoS homepage


 o XaoS has problems with certain compilers (including some versions of GCC)
   please read README.compilers for more information.
 o Crashes under X11 with higher resolutions
   This may be caused by limits on the size of the shared memory area. 
   Please try -nomitshm options. This happends often on FreeBSD systems.
 o Dos version crashes even with clean DOS
   This may be caused (and very often is) by a hardware problem.
   Many computers are overclocked (configured to run faster than the CPU
   and motherboard is supposed to support). This problem is very common on
   computers running Pentium 100 at 120 or even 133 Mhz.
   GCC (the compiler used for XaoS) generates good that often overheats
   processor (for example my 486 after 20 minutes of compiling gets from approx. 28^C
   to approx 80^C...). It is not easy to notice such problem with other applications since
   it usually does not have effect for most DOS application, and failing in Windows
   normal.

   In XaoS this problem causes random crashes while XaoS is running, or crashes immediately
   after startup

   Also Cyrix 686 are known to have problems with the startup menu. If you are
   interested I can send you a version w/o this menu.

   Please browse you setup and put higher waitstates, turn off caches, turn off turbo
   and simply do everything that should slow down your computer. If this helps,
   your hardware simply can't cope with the higher speed reliably.

 o other problems?
   see driver specific documentation
