This file is for developers.

I will give you a short description on how XaoS handles
the built-in formulas and how to make one.

0.) So, in the file "formulas.c" in the library /src/engine/,
you shall find some lines containing macros starting with 

#define VARIABLES

or something like it, and ending with

#include "docalc.c"

It's tricky, because every time when you include this file, 
it means something different. It depends upon how you 
defined the macros. You can understand easily what a macro does.

Make your own formula here.

Then, two other things are to do.

1.) First, you must put the description of your formula at the end of
the structure named "formulas". You can make it to be similar to the
other formula descriptions.

1. FORMULAMAGIC
2. CALC function
3. PERI function
4. SCALC function
5. SPERI function
6. JULIA function
7. {"Name of Mandelbrot", "Name of Julia"}
8. "short name"
9. point of view: {x_translate, y_translate, ?, scale}
10. hassymmetry
11. isMandelbrot (or Julia, at startup)
12. pre -- real part of Julia seed
13. pim -- imag part of Julia seed
14. {{}{}... structures about the symmetries of the outcoloring modes}
15. {{}{}... structures about the symmetries of the incoloring modes}

These are made:
{vertical_symmetry, horizontical_symmetry, 
 size_of_other_symmetries, other_symmetries}

Horizontical and vertical symmetries can be INT_MAX or 0, 
INT_MAX means no symmetry, 0 means symmetry
The next two is like: {... 2, sym6} {... 2, sym8} or {... 6, sym16}

16. some FLAGS, (I still don't know what they mean.)

2.) When this is done, you must put your new functions in the four
switch commands at the end of the file.

3.) I hope there are no complications...
After compiling XaoS, you should find your fractal at the 
"More Formulae" menu.
