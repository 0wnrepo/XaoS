 o Fixes
 o Updates to the documentatio:
 o Another change to the print_menus format - menu header is now printed in
 the reversed order and keyword is in quotes. Just to keep same syntax as used
 by other parts.
 o Documentation split into Hacker's and user's guide. They are now separate
 manuals, so we don't need to distribute hacker's documentation in the binarry
 distributions and save some disc space. Also users don't need to print this.
 o Automatical conversion script to convert xaos.hlp into chapters in texinfo
 manual.
 o Keys are now case-sensitive
 o Menu rotation improvements
 o Fixes in menu handling
 o Another handling of 'z' key
