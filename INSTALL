For Unix/X11:

   To compile XaoS you need optimizing ansi compatible C compiler
   and at least one of the following libraries:
    o Xlib
    o SVGAlib
    o AA-lib 
    o GGI
   To compile XaoS with image saving code you also need zlib and
   pnglib installed. They are available at:

   ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/png/src/zlib-0.95.tar.gz
   ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/png/src/libpng-0.81.tar.gz

   AA-lib is a library alowing high quality ascii-art output
   from XaoS available at AA-project homepage http://www.ta.jcu.cz/aa)

   To use internationalization (i18n) you also need GNU gettext
   (which is automatically available on most Unix systems and also
   exists on DOS).

   XaoS now have configure script so following should work correctly:

        CFLAGS=(your best size optimizing switches)
        CFLAGS1=(your best speed optimizing switches)
				export CFLAGS

				   #note that this two steps are not required on pc/Linux
           #and on all gcc compilers XaoS uses quite good switches.
           #but this is REQUIRED for other compilers, because XaoS
           #is coded to be good target for optimizer and NEEDS to
           #be optimized to work in reasonable speed

	./configure [options...usually not required]
	make
	make install

   You may also read compilers.txt, that contain info about various
   compiler, best optimizing switches and common problems, since XaoS
   often forces compilers (including gcc) to crash/generate wrong code
   
   For better results:
   Edit config.autoconf to reflect your system. 

   IMPORTANT NOTE:
   XaoS sould optionally use long double for zooming. It allows
   deeper zooms with no performance lost at intel platforms. Some
   other platforms supports long double too, but it is usually
   emulated so it is incredibly slow. Configure script by default
   enables long double just at i?86 and unknown processors.

   If you have processor reported as unknown that is non intel and
   XaoS is incredibly slow, please try:
   ./configure -with-long-double=no
   make clean;
   make
   to recompile XaoS. Please let me know about this problem, so
   autodetection should be included into future versions of configure
   script.

   If you have time to experiment and some non intel-compatible
   platform, please try:
   ./configure -with-long-double=yes
   make clean
   make
   And try whether XaoS still works at same speed(framerate is displayed
   using l key) and let me know in case that XaoS still works at same
   higher/bit slower(not 100times or so) speed, so I should your platform
   autodetect in future version of script. I did unsucesfull test at
   following archiotectures/processors:
   HP425e - Motorola MC68040
   HP700 - Parisc
   SGI
   SUN
   But it should change at various processor types, so I don't say
   that all SGI's or SUNs does not work with long double.

   options available:
     By default XaoS will try to configure and compile following drivers
      X11
      SVGAlib
      Curses
     This may cause some problems. To reduce binary file size and/or
     solve such problems you may disable driver using:
      --with-x11-driver=no     to disable X11 driver
      --with-svga-driver=no    to disable SVGAlib driver
      --with-curses-driver=no  to disable (N)Curses driver
     There may be problems with configuring bit non standard curses
     library. You may use following options:
      --with-sunos-curses      to force SunOS 4.x curses
      --with-osf1-curses	     to force OSF/1 curses
      --with-vcurses[=incdir]  to force SysV curses
      --with-ncurses[=base-dir]    to compile with ncurses/locate base dir
      --with-x                 use the X Window System
     Also finding X includes should be a problem.
      --x-includes=DIR        X include files are in DIR
      --x-libraries=DIR       X library files are in DIR
     For Linux gpm library use:
      --with-gpm-mouse=base-dir    specifies the base gpm directory
     To enable experimental SMP support use:
      --with-pthread=yes
     note that it is really untested in version 3.0 since I don't have
     SMP machine :) (someone who should lend me some?)

     Threaded version works well with aadriver, partially (w/o console
     switching) with SVGAlib driver and X11 driver needs patched Xlib
     for threads. I believe it will be normal soon (when glibc will
     become more popular)

   Note that XaoS is automatically installed with sticky bit enabled when
   svgadriver is compiled, but it is sticky bit safe since it switches to
   normal privilegies after drivers are initialized.


For Win32:
   To build XaoS you need CygWin32 compiler b20 or later (a quite good GCC
   clone for UNIX. See http://sourceware.cygnus.com), directX headers
   hacked for gcc, pnglib and zlib. The build procedure is similar to UNIX.
   Do:

   sh configure
   make

   Everything should be autodetected. If you have installed X11 or GGI
   libraries, XaoS should build their drivers as well.

For DOS:
   You need djgpp gnu compiler, allegro graphics, zlib and pnglib
   Use:

   build.bat
	
	 If you get in trouble, please read INSTALL.dos.

For Mac:
    Read README.mac for more informations
For plan9:
    XaoS comes with mk script because I am unable to write functional
    mkfile on my reduced system.
    start mk and wait..

You may also get binary distribution.
